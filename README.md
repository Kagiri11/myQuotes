This is an app that I built to learn internal android storage using the Room library for data persistence and dependency injection using Dagger Hilt.

I have used Truth for Unit and Instrumented testing.

## Room and how to use it
So, what is this Room thing? Room is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library used for data persistence. What Room does is that it provides an abstraction layer over SQLite making it very easy to play around with databases while giving you SQLites powerful properties.

Being among one of android's jetpack components, Room hugely simplifies and cleans how you work with SQLiteDatabase objects. One of its benefits is that SQL queries get verified at compile time. This is good cause if there's an error it's you as a dev that will experience it rather than pushing it to runtime.

### Elements of Room Database
To use Room, we have this components;
- Entity
- Dao (Data Access Objects)
- Database

#### Entity
To represent a table in Room, you prepend your data class with @Entity annotation. Room will feature that class as a table and the class fields as the table's columns.
 - @PrimaryKey -You use this to tell room to use that field as the primary key of the table
 - @ColumnInfo -Use this annotation to tell room to use the provided name as the name of a column in the table
 - @Ignore - the annotated field wont be covered by Room for persistence

#### Dao
Normally interfaces, Daos layout the methods we would normally use to interact with our database. For this too, there are annotations to access and deal with the data from the database.

#### Database
Finally we get to talk about the db, this is the gateway to the app's persisted data. Annotated with @Database, the db is usually set up as an abstract class and subclasses RoomDatabase. At the point of annotation, we should provide the list of entities associated with it.
Our database is also required to provide a function that returns a dao from which we can interact with the db.
